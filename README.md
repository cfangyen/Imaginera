OVERVIEW

"_frequency_Imaginera": Imaginera algorithm for analyzing locomotor frequency

"_frequency_segmentation": Segmentation algorithm for analyzing locomotion frequency

"_PCA_subtraction": Algorithm for performing background subtraction from videos using a principle component analysis (PCA)

"_sample_data": A sample dataset for demonstrating the usage of Imaginera and segmentation-based methods


INSTRUCTION:

Imaginera: Run "HJ_FreqAnalysis_Batch_Highres.m" to initiate the Imaginera analysis of the sample dataset.  Specific comments and instruction are included within the scripts.

Segmentation: Run "Generating_normal_atlas.m" to initiate the segmentation analysis of the sample dataset.  Specific comments and instruction are included within the scripts.

PCA background subtraction: Run "HJ_PCA_subtraction.m" to do background subtraction for videos before frequency analysis.

Sample data: This dataset is for demonstration only.  Each video (30 fps) in this dataset records a C. elegans nematode exhibiting forward locomotion in liquid NGM buffer within a microfluidic chamber.
